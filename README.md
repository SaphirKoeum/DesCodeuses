- Tips : Use docker exec -ti.... command to log into the container

## Exercise II

A/ Submit the folder containing your dockerfile to GitHub repository : https://github.com/rovland/descodeuses.git
- Tips : Use GitHub Desktop application for windows or directly use git command line such as git clone, git commit -m, git push

F/ Find a way to fix all errors occur by editing your jenkinsfile on local
- Tips : Using the 'replay' option on a jenkins build job, it's straightforward to quickly test your modifications
